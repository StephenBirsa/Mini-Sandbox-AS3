# Mini Sandbox
A Minecraft-like functionality of building and breaking blocks.
I built a square world with a square person, and managed the screen as a chunk.

I assume the game can create as many chunks as the max value for an int (integer): 2,147,483,647.
The game I used a form of positive chunks and negative.

You can go either left or right, and keep loading new chunks.
The starting point is inbetween both the negative and positive chunks.

There can be a max of 2,147,483,647 positive chunks and a max of
2,147,483,647 negative chunks.

The total assumed max chunks saved to the hard drive could potentially be 4,294,967,294 chunks (2,147,483,647 + 2,147,483,647).

I made this in 2016 in ActionScript 3.0 + Adobe Air using FlashDevelop.
